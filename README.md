# Bandanas to Skins
Bandanas to Skins adds a skin system to the existing bandanas of the Commonwealth of Fallout 4, as well as several faction and pride themed skins.

## Explanation
The skin modifications system of Fallout 4 is extremely powerful, allowing players to customize almost any piece of equipment armor or clothing they could want. It's also criminally underused, only used to modify power armor in the base game, and a small selection of weapons, armor and your Pip-Boy when using Creation Club add-ons.

I think I could do better, making better use of the systems in place while not resorting to bloated, terrible mods like AWKCR or Armorsmith Extended.

This mod changes all existing bandana variants so that they can be dynamically reskinned and adds a large variety of new skins to the game, including faction skins, pride skins, and flat colored skins.
